# NETBOOT.XYZ Build Environment

## Intro

The purpose of this repository is 2 parts: 

- Maintain the centralized logic used by asset builders conventionally publishing the contents of Live CD ISOs or customized Kernel/Initrd combos with specific logic to allow booting from a github HTTPS endpoint.

- Be an evolving written explanation of the current state of the automated build system spanning all of these externally ingested assets.

Outside of these core principles this document should provide as much possible information on how to properly participate in the project as a whole.
